# Firebase Studio

This is a NextJS starter in Firebase Studio.

To get started, take a look at src/app/page.tsx.

## 배포하기 (Publishing your app)

This app is configured for deployment using Firebase App Hosting.

To deploy your app, simply click the **"Publish"** button in the Firebase Studio interface (usually located in the top-right corner).

This will automatically:
1.  Build your Next.js application for production.
2.  Read the `apphosting.yaml` file for configuration.
3.  Deploy the built application to a live URL on Firebase App Hosting.

There is no need to manually run `npm run build` or use `git push` for deployment when using the integrated "Publish" feature.
